                <h4 style="color: gray">Registration</h4>
                1. M.Sc. students may seek registration after they have
                fulfilled the 12 credit requirement, subject to Departmental
                evaluation of their coursework and research performance. A
                minimum residence period of one year after registration will be
                required for award of the M.Sc. degree. Inform your advisor when
                you have passed (or expect to pass) courses worth 12 credits.
                You can do this a couple of months ahead of time. Your advisor
                will then inform you about the Department's approval for your
                registration. Registration procedures are handled by the
                University Cell.

                <br /><br />2. It is the responsibility of the student to check
                that the DBS Office has a record of your course grades. Before
                you begin registration procedures, check that your final course
                grades are with DBS Office.

                <br /><br />3. IMPORTANT: when you have registered, provide DBS
                Office a copy of the document that states your date of
                registration.<br /><br /><br />
                <h4 style="color: gray">Submission of Synopsis/Thesis</h4>
                4. Synopsis should be submitted as TWO hard copies and one CD
                with synopsis to your advisor. The CD should be IDENTICAL to the
                printout. It is recommended to burn the CD first, and print out
                from this.

                <br /><br />5. Advisor should ascertain that the student has met
                all the requirements for the M.Sc. degree. Then the advisor
                should list names of 4 potential external examiners and give the
                materials to Convener, Biology Subject Board. The convener is
                Prof. Upendra Bhalla (NCBS), and Prof. Shobhona Sharma is
                Subject Board representative in Mumbai who will handle matters
                on Prof. Mathew's behalf.

                <br /><br />6. The Subject board will ensure that the student
                has completed the coursework before forwarding the synopsis
                onward. The Synopsis will be considered by the Subject Board and
                will be forwarded, together with selected names of examiner(s),
                to the University Cell.

                <br /><br />7. The student should pay Synopsis fees to Cashier
                and give the University Cell the receipt. When (3) and (4)
                happen, the Synopsis has been "accepted." DEADLINE for Synopsis
                submission: 1st APRIL of your 3rd year (but you can submit much
                earlier too- up to 6 months prior to submitting your Thesis).

                <br /><br />8. Thesis submission: There is no minimum time
                between synopsis submission and thesis submission. In principle
                this can happen on the same day. Thesis should be submitted
                WITHIN 6 MONTHS from the synopsis "acceptance" date. DEADLINE
                for Thesis submission: 1st MAY of your 3rd year.

                <br /><br />9. Examination date will be set by University Cell
                in communication with the external examiner and the advisor.
                Examinations will happen in the month of JULY of your 3rd year,
                but ONLY if you have submitted your thesis on time.

                <br /><b
                  >Please note that you may need to revise your thesis according
                  to the examiners' suggestions. You should remember to factor
                  this time component in when you make your plans for the next
                  stage of your career.</b
