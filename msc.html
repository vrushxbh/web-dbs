                This is a 3-year program. Students start in July each year, and
                join labs to which they have been assigned in their offer
                letter. These assignments are strongly based on their
                preferences ascertained during the interview process - we do not
                want unhappy students wandering our hallways! If you are truly
                flexible and open in what you want to do, say so; if you have a
                genuine preference, please let us know and we'll do the best we
                can to accommodate it.

                <br /><br />MSc students attend basic core courses together with
                the Ph.D. and Int. Ph.D. students. The 12 credit requirement is
                satisfied by these courses, after which MSc students engage in
                full time research. On consultation with their advisors,
                advanced courses may also be attended. M.Sc. students are
                offered the same diverse training experiences as their Int.
                Ph.D. counterparts, all of which contribute to making a good
                scientist. Each lab has lab meetings in which experiments are
                discussed suggestions are offered, and the department has weekly
                seminars from invited speakers as well as journal clubs in which
                research papers are critiqued. Students often spend a few months
                in other labs in India or abroad, to learn a new technique that
                they require for their work. In addition, students travel to
                scientific meetings within India and abroad and present their
                work to the broader community in their field. Besides this,
                students have opportunities to present lectures or TA a course,
                to engage in informal mentoring of junior students, to get
                involved in TIFR's annual public outreach events, to give
                lectures or seminars at colleges in Mumbai, to judge school
                science festivals, to create new exciting tools to take science
                to schools- all these enhance the research training we offer.

                <br /><br />At the end of their M.Sc. training, our students get
                accepted to Ph.D. programs in top-notch labs all over the world.
