                1. What fields of research can I do my Integrated Ph.D. research
                in?
                <br />See the webpages for research in biology at DBS and NCBS.
                Students are allowed to join the laboratory of their choice
                after doing lab rotations during the first semester. Typically,
                no laboratory requires prior background in that particular field
                of research; strong interest and commitment are the only
                necessary factors. Background is acquired within a few months of
                joining your laboratory of interest. It is not unusual for
                students with background in *any* branch of Biology, Physics, or
                Chemistry, or even Medical, Dentistry, or Veterinary
                backgrounds, to join a laboratory in a completely different
                area. These students do very well. We encourage students to
                follow their interests, rather than consider themselves
                restricted because of their backgrounds.

                <br /><br />2. I would like to know about the written test. What
                is the syllabus? What is the Interview like? <br />The Biology
                Integrated Ph.D. test is held on a specific Sunday in December
                each year, at centers all over India. Details of how to apply
                for a Hall ticket will be available on our website and on the
                NCBS website in September each year. The test consists of
                multiple choice questions covering *basics only* in physics,
                chemistry, maths, biology. There is no guide book and no
                syllabus. No special knowledge or preparation is required.
                Revise your basics, that is all. The Interview will be based on
                whatever area you are most interested and most comfortable in.

                <br /><br />3. I am a Chemistry or Physics B.Sc., I want to do
                Integrated Ph.D. in Biology. Should I appear for both the
                written tests, Chemistry (or Physics) as well as Biology? I am
                worried that I will not do well in the Biology test. <br />You
                can sit for *either* or *both* of the tests, and we will use
                your best score. For your information, the Biology test has 4
                sections on *basics* of Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Maths.
                This is designed so that people from various disciplines can be
                selected according to their strengths. You will have to apply
                for two hall tickets and send two separate DDs (one with each
                application) if you appear for two exams.

                <br /><br />4. Can I think of the Integrated Ph.D. programme as
                an M.Sc. programme (i.e. plan to submit an M.Sc. and leave in 3
                years?) <br />This option will not be available. Integrated
                Ph.D. students take time doing rotations before they join a lab
                to start work. Then, they have to submit two project proposals
                that consume a lot of time. Finally, they are given longer
                (Ph.D. level) projects that do not wind up in 3 years. Therefore
                it is not possible to complete a project in 3 years. In our
                experience, students know very well whether or not they are
                ready to commit for the full 6 year Integrated Ph.D. programme.
                If you're not ready to commit, don't apply- the Integrated Ph.D.
                programme is not for you. If your plans are to do an M.Sc. in
                TIFR and do your Ph.D. elsewhere, then that's what our M.Sc.
                programme is designed for.

                <br /><br />Students who are interested in applying to our
                Integrated Ph.D. programme are welcome to email any of our
                current students via our web page, and ask what you need to
                know.

                <br /><br />If you email faculty members directly, you may not
                get a reply if the information you need is already contained in
                our website! This is not because we are not interested in
                talking to you, but because we get thousands of applications,
                and it is not possible to answer individually questions that are
                already answered here.
