                  Your past record, your one-page write-up as well as your
                  letters of recommendation will be considered. In our past
                  experience, "good marks" do not necessarily make for a good
                  research student; all students who are motivated to learn
                  research skills are encouraged to apply. BSc-qualified
                  candidates in any branch of biology, physics, or chemistry are
                  welcome. The Ph.D./ Int. Ph.D. written test will also function
                  as the written test for our M.Sc. program. The procedure for
                  appearing for this test will be available on our website and
                  on the NCBS website in September each year. The test will be
                  held at centers all over India, held on a specific Sunday in
                  December, for admission the following July. The test consists
                  of multiple-choice questions covering *basics only* in
                  physics, chemistry, math, biology. There is no guide book and
                  no syllabus. No special knowledge or preparation is required.
                  Revise your basic that is all. The Interview will be based on
                  whatever your BSc background is in, or whatever area you are
                  most interested or most comfortable in.

                  2. What is the curriculum for the M.Sc. program?<br />
                  Our M.Sc. students experience a unique curriculum that changes
                  their outlook on what science has to offer. Rather than
                  getting "narrowed down" as some people fear, learning how to
                  do research in a particular field gives you the ability to
                  understand and read research papers in any other field.
                  Research work means a training of the mind, so you will learn
                  to ask precise questions about any problem at hand. Your
                  research project will be carried out under guidance of one of
                  the Faculty members in our Department. You will learn how to
                  do experiments; how to plan an experimental approach; how to
                  interpret your data; how to troubleshoot problems. Typically,
                  the research projects our student's work on result in
                  publications in International Journals. Coursework: 12 credits
                  of required coursework. Journal Clubs and Seminars: These are
                  ongoing series throughout the year that will open your mind to
                  cutting edge research all over the world. The "Research
                  Methodology" course will teach you the techniques used in all
                  types of work, so you can understand the Journal Club and
                  Seminars. Meetings: Periodically, you will have the
                  opportunity to attend meetings at other Institutes in India,
                  and present your work there. In the past year our students
                  have attended meetings in Kanpur, Banglore, Pune, and Delhi as
                  part of their curriculum.

                  3. Will my options become "narrowed down" as a result of doing
                  a M.Sc. research project in a particular field?<br />
                  Our M.Sc. students are assigned to a laboratory based on their
                  interests. During the interview we spend a good deal of time
                  trying to ascertain what area the student is interested in
                  working in, or we help them clarify their interests. The goal
                  is to have students who are happy to have joined our program,
                  rather than to take in good students and force them into
                  something that they are not happy to do! How will this help
                  your future career? ANY good Ph.D. program in India or abroad
                  encourages candidates with diverse backgrounds to apply, and
                  welcomes this diversity into their Ph.D. student pool. Biology
                  is perhaps unique in that background in any area is easy to
                  acquire at any stage, without specific prerequisite courses at
                  the BSc or M.Sc. level. After a research training in any area
                  in Biology, students can read, understand, and even switch to
                  any other area in Biology. Examples of this are so numerous,
                  that in more progressive countries, switching from one area of
                  Biology to another is the norm, rather than the exception.
                  Students with backgrounds in e.g. Microbiology can do an M.Sc.
                  in Neurobiology, which does not in the least hamper their
                  chances of getting accepted to Ph.D. programs in, say,
                  Immunology. What selection committees (including ours) ask at
                  the Ph.D. Interview level is "How well do you know what you
                  have been studying before?". This is an extremely good
                  indicator of how you will do at whatever area of biology you
                  want to pursue, rather than a one-track background in that
                  area. Our Ph.D. program has in the past offered admission to
                  students whose previous training was in Physics, Engineering,
                  Medicine, and Dentistry. Therefore it is simply not true that
                  doing research "narrows you down". Rather, it broadens your
                  abilities and your interests in a way that traditional courses
                  do not, since typically courses treat science as a "finished
                  product" to be learned, rather than an ongoing process of
                  discovery to be understood. Doing research allows you to
                  participate in the discovery, and you will never look at
                  science the same way again.

                  for M.Sc. students from this program?<br />
                  A well-rounded M.Sc. education, with coursework and research
                  training, is our goal for this M.Sc. program. Therefore we
                  require a 3-year commitment from students. Our M.Sc. students
                  better their prospects considerably as a result of the
                  training they receive. Due to the exposure to a broad range of
                  research in biology, students are able to define their future
                  interests very well. Our M.Sc. students typically get
                  admission to excellent Ph.D. programs in India and abroad, on
                  the strength of their publications and their understanding of
                  what they want to do. Other options are jobs in the Biomedical
                  industry, or Project assistant positions at research
                  institutions.

                  5. Is housing available?<br />
                  Unfortunately, we do not currently offer housing to M.Sc.
                  students, so students have to make their own arrangements.
                  However, TIFR does provide a generous stipend, for latest

                  6. Can I think of the Integrated Ph.D. program as an M.Sc.
                  program (i.e. plan to submit an M.Sc. and leave in 3
                  years?)<br />
                  This option will not be available. Integrated Ph.D. students
                  take time doing rotaions before they join a lab to start work.
                  Then, they have to submit two project proposals that consume a
                  lot of time. Finally, they are given longer (Ph.D. level)
                  projects that do not wind up in 3 years. Therefore it is not
                  possible to finish a project in 3 years. In our experience,
                  students know very well whether or not they are ready to
                  commit for the full 6 year Int. Ph.D. program. If you're not
                  ready to commit, don't apply- the Int. Ph.D. program is not
                  for you. If your plans are to do an M.Sc. in TIFR and do your
                  Ph.D. elsewhere, then that's what our M.Sc. program is
                  designed for. We provide guidance, advice, discussions, and
                  strong support to our M.Sc. students when they are trying to
                  decide what they want to work on for their Ph.D. and help them
                  decide where to apply to do it. Our M.Sc. students get into
                  top-notch programs world-wide to pursue their Ph.D.

                  7. Do you offer "M.Sc. Biotechnology?"<br />
                  "Biotechnology" is now used as a general term for "modern
                  biology". All Biotechnology courses in India offer a broad
                  spectrum of interesting and modern courses in a range of
                  topics... so the term "biotechnology" means everything and
                  nothing at the same time! Our M.Sc. degree is in "Biology".
                  Our courses are listed on this website, and the research we do
                  is also presented. Students should apply if they want to learn
                  and do research in the areas we describe on our website.<br /><br />
                  Students who are interested in applying to our M.Sc. program
                  are welcome to email any of our current M.Sc. students who
                  will give you a feel of what it was like for them to move from
                  a exclusively coursework system to a program with a strong
                  emphasis on research. You may contact them via our web page,
                  introduce yourself, and ask what you need to know. If you
                  email faculty members directly, you may not get a reply if the
                  information you need is already contained in our website! This
                  is not because we are not interested in talking to you, but
                  because we get hundreds of applications, and it is not
                  possible to answer individually questions that are already

                  date on the website, yes!) <br />Any scope to get a project
                  here still? <br />(No, sorry!)

                  <br /><br />Each year, we also get phone calls and emails from
                  bankers, doctors, collegeprincipals, professors, scientists,
                  businessmen/women, administrative officials... on behalf of
                  either their own sons, daughters, nieces, nephews, or their
                  friends' sons, daughters, nieces, nephews... we even get phone
                  calls in our homes, at night, or repeated calls throughout the
                  working day! Usually these questions are about information
                  that already exists on our website. For these well meaning
                  people (and for the students/parents who may have requested
                  them to intercede on the student's behalf) we have the
                  following information: <br />a) If a student wants "general
                  advice and counseling about careers", we encourage them to
                  first use the internet to obtain some of the information they
                  need. Gone are the days when "guidance" must be obtained from
                  some older (and supposedly wiser) person. This generation of
                  students can find much of what they need to know on the
                  internet by doing simple searches for keywords. Look up
                  viruses, cancer, brain, genetics, whatever topic you are
                  interested in! Read some of the material on the internet and
                  then, email specific people with specific enquiries, rather
                  than general requests for advice. It will help your career
                  plans greatly if you first explore on internet by yourself,
                  get basic information, then ask questions. <br />b) Most
                  importantly, we encourage students to make their enquiries
                  themselves, rather than having someone else do it on their
                  behalf. A student old enough to vote, obtain a drivers
                  license, and even get married, should develop the independence
                  to ask questions for himself/herself- that is the first step
                  if you wish to enter science. Put in the effort; you will
                  discover what it takes to frame a good and focused question-
                  after you have searched the internet- and how to identify the
                  right person to address it to (email only please!). Hopefully
                  you will also discover that at least in science, the answer is
                  the same regardless of who asks the question- it is not
                  necessary to ask some "important" person to make the enquiry
                  on your behalf. Also, at least in science, learning to ask the
                  right question is itself a training experience!
